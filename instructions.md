The course consists of:
* [Class sessions](#class-sessions)
* [Paper readings and reviews](#paper-readings-and-reviews)
* [Presentations](#presentations)
* [A research project](#research-project)

## Class sessions
* Class sessions combine lectures, discussions of reading, and presentations by students. 
* The class is focused around discussion. Please comment, question, and interact.

## Paper readings and reviews
* Classes will have one or two assigned readings, which we will all read prior to class and discuss during the class. Reading the papers is essential to get the most out of this course!
* You must submit (on Piazza) a paper review for each of the assigned readings. A one-paragraph review is sufficient. **Your reviews should not summarize the paper or repeat the abstract. Instead your review should comprise at least three comments on the paper**. For example, a comment might be: 
  * a criticism of the paper
  * an advantage of the paper that was not discussed in the paper
  * a suggestion of a way to extend or build on the paper in future work
  * a response to another student's comment

* Your reviews should contain material that doesn't appear in the other students' reviews. (If you independently produce the same idea, that's fine. Copying other students' reviews, however, is plagiarism.)
* You are encouraged to read, think about, and comment on the other students' reviews.
* Submit your review **by 11:59 pm the night before the lecture** for which the paper was assigned, by posting it on Piazza.
* You **may skip any 2 paper reviews** over the course of the semester without affecting your grade. Except in extreme cases, the instructor will not grant additional free passes on the reviews.
* Reviews that are submitted on time and meet the guidelines above will be given full credit. 


## Presentations 
* Each student will lead a paper presentation at least once. 
* All students must sign up for a presentation slot.
* 20 minutes long, typically, 15 slides per paper. 2-3 slides on motivation and background. 5-7 slides on core ideas of the paper. 3-5 slides on experimental data. 2-3 slides on your thoughts/criticisms/questions/discussion points about the paper.
* Your presentation should be original and independent. You are allowed to cooperate with your partner for your session. 
* Reusing slides from someone else's presentation should be done only if it is absolutely necessary, but should be acknowledged right at the beginning of the presentation. 

## Research project
* **coming soon**

## Policies on Ethics, Attribution and Cheating
* The standard university policies on original work, cheating and attribution apply to all work in the course. Violation of these may result in either lowering of course grade by one letter, or failing the course, or a different final decision left to the instructor.
